Ever year, I gather every possible shred of statistical information about each and every goalie, and make it available for everyone in this document. In particular, this data comes from the NHL, Hockey Reference, Corsica Hockey, Natural Stat Trick, First Line Stats, among many other sources. Please support these sites.

Please let me know if you find any errors, or if you have suggestions. If you're reading this, then this is just the second version, and there are still some more stats on the way, like home plate save percentage. So, stay tuned, and be prepared to download an update in the future.

Enjoy!

May 26: Added shootout data, quality of competition, saves above opponent-based expectations, etc.
